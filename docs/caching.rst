CloudFront
==========

To estimate the cost of using CloudFront, you need to consider the following:

* **Traffic distribution**. Data transfer and request pricing vary across geographic regions, and pricing is based on the edge location through which your content is served.

* **Requests**. The number and type of requests made and the geographic region in which the requests are made.

* **Data transfer out**. The amount of data transferred out of your Amazon CloudFront edge locations.
