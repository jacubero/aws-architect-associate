Decoupling with Amazon SNS
**************************

Amazon SNS
==========

The most important characteristics of SNS are the following:

* It is a flexible, fully managed pub/sub messaging and mobile communications service.

* It coordinates the delivery of messages to subscribing endpoints and clients, therefore enabling you to send different information to different subscribers.

* It is easy to setup, operate and send realiable communications. 

* It allows you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems and serverless communications.

Amazon SNS allows you to have pub/sub messaging for different systems in Amazon, like AWS Lambda, HTTP/S and Amazon SQS. Amazon SNS Mobile Notifications allows you to do similar publishing but to different mobile systems, like ADM, APNS, Baidu, GCM, MPNS, and WNS.
