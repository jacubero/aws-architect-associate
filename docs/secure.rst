Domain 3: Specify Secure Applications and Architectures
#######################################################

Design Principles
*****************

`Security Pillar <https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/architecture/AWS-Security-Pillar.pdf>`_

In the cloud, there are a number of principles that can help you strengthen your system security:

* **Implement a strong identity foundation**: Implement the principle of least privilege and enforce separation of duties with appropriate authorization for each interaction with your AWS resources. Centralize privilege management and reduce or even eliminate reliance on longterm credentials.

* **Enable traceability**: Monitor, alert, and audit actions and changes to your environment in real time. Integrate logs and metrics with systems to automatically respond and take action.

* **Apply security at all layers**: Rather than just focusing on protection of a single outer layer, apply a defense-in-depth approach with other security controls. Apply to all layers (e.g., edge network, VPC, subnet, load balancer, every instance, operating system, and application).

* **Automate security best practices**: Automated software-based security mechanisms improve your ability to securely scale more rapidly and cost effectively. Create secure architectures, including the implementation of controls that are defined and managed as code in version-controlled templates.

* **Protect data in transit and at rest**: Classify your data into sensitivity levels and use mechanisms, such as encryption, tokenization, and access control where appropriate.

* **Keep people away from data**: Create mechanisms and tools to reduce or eliminate the need for direct access or manual processing of data. This reduces the risk of loss or modification and human error when handling sensitive data.

* **Prepare for security events**: Prepare for an incident by having an incident management process that aligns to your organizational requirements. Run incident response simulations and use tools with automation to increase your speed for detection, investigation, and recovery

Areas
*****

Security in the cloud is composed of five areas:

1. Identity and access management

2. Detective controls

3. Infrastructure protection

4. Data protection

5. Incident response
